# Cybersecurity Investigation Reports

## Overview

This repository contains detailed cybersecurity investigation reports documenting traffic analysis, incident simulations, and detection exercises performed using tools such as **Wireshark, Snort, Splunk, and pfSense**. Each report captures key findings, timestamps, and evidence of malicious or suspicious activities, with the goal of improving detection and response strategies.

## Structure

Each report follows a consistent structure for clarity and reproducibility:

1. **Executive Summary**  
   - High-level overview of the investigation and its purpose.

2. **Incident Details**  
   - Description of the traffic, attack type, or suspicious activity under investigation.

3. **Environment Setup**  
   - Tools, systems, network topology, and configurations used.

4. **Evidence Collected**  
   - Relevant Wireshark or IDS/IPS packet captures with timestamp explanations.  
   - Detection & Alerts (e.g., Snort alerts).  
   - SIEM correlation or Splunk dashboard results.  
   - Sample screenshots.

5. **Technical Analysis**  
   - Timeline of Attack.  
   - Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

6. **Findings & Root Cause Analysis**  
   - Detailed explanation of what was discovered.  
   - Tactics/techniques mapped to frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK).

7. **Recommendations**  
   - Security controls, policies, or configurations to prevent recurrence.

8. **Conclusion**  
   - Wrap-up of the investigation, lessons learned, and implications.

9. **Appendix**  
   - Full packet captures (PCAP), Snort rules, Splunk queries, or scripts used.
